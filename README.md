# Removing a Commit from Main While Keeping a Backup

This guide explains how to remove a commit from the `main` branch while keeping it safely stored in a separate backup branch.

## **Step 1: Create a Backup Branch**
Before removing the commit, create a backup branch that retains the commit:

```sh
# Switch to main and create a backup branch from the commit
# Use the commit hash that you want to remove from the main branch
git checkout -b backup-removed-commit b48671c072dc598a1c09af265604c6326c0b7f27

# Push the backup branch to remote
git push origin backup-removed-commit
```

This ensures that the commit remains accessible even after it is removed from `main`.

---

## **Step 2: Remove the Commit from `main`**
Switch back to the `main` branch:

```sh
git checkout main
```

Start an interactive rebase to remove the commit:

```sh
# Enter the previous commit hash of the targetted commit. Make sure you only select the previous commit 
git rebase -i --rebase-merges <commit_before_b48671c072dc598a1c09af265604c6326c0b7f27>
```

In the interactive rebase editor:
1. Locate the line containing `b48671c072dc598a1c09af265604c6326c0b7f27`. In this case, the commit you want to remove
2. Delete that line.
3. Save and close the editor.

This will remove the commit while keeping the rest of the history intact.

---

## **Step 3: Force Push to Update Remote**
Since this process rewrites history, you need to force push the updated `main` branch:

```sh
git push origin main --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This operation rewrites history. If others are working on the same branch, coordinate with them before pushing.

---

## **Final Result**
- The commit `b48671c072dc598a1c09af265604c6326c0b7f27` is no longer in `main`.
- The commit is safely stored in the `backup-removed-commit` branch.
- If needed, you can restore the commit from the backup:

```sh
git checkout backup-removed-commit
```

---

## **Restoring the Commit to Main (If Needed)**
If you ever need to restore the commit back to `main`, use:

```sh
git checkout main
git cherry-pick b48671c072dc598a1c09af265604c6326c0b7f27
```

This will reapply the commit to `main` without affecting other changes.
